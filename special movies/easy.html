			 It is inspired by the 1962 Italian film The Getaway.
	 
			Winner of numerous awards and candidate for many others,<br>
			 the film Easy Rider is considered a milestone of the 1960s counterculture <br>
			 and a fundamental paradigm in the history of cinema in its country and the world. It is one of the precursors of independent production,<br>
			  and with it it was raised one hundred times more than its production cost.<br>
	 
		   
			Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) are two young people who embark on a journey crossing the southwestern and southern<br>
			 United States with the goal of attending the Mardi Gras carnival in New Orleans. To finance their trip, they use cocaine trafficking <br>
			 on the border with Mexico. With their motorcycles they embark on a journey in which they get to know different faces of American society.<br>
	 
		   
			Along the way they meet various and unusual characters, a rancher and his family, a hippie hitchhiker, end up being arrested <br>
			in a small town for parading without a permit, where they meet George (Jack Nicholson), an alcoholic lawyer who gets them out of trouble.<br>
			 jail and then decides to join them.
