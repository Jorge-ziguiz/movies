        Ghost Rider is a 2007 American superhero film written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson.<br>
         Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, it was produced by Columbia Pictures<br>
          in association with Marvel Entertainment, Crystal Sky Pictures, and Relativity Media, and distributed<br>
           by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film stars Nicolas Cage as the titular character, with Eva Mendes. <br>
 
 
        Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman sells his soul and becomes a bounty hunter of evil demons: the Ghost Rider.
       
       <br>
       The demon Mephistopheles sends his bounty hunter of the damned, the Ghost Rider, to retrieve the contract of<br>
        San Venganza for control of a thousand corrupt souls. Seeing that the agreement would give Mephistopheles the power<br>
         to bring hell on Earth, the Rider refuses and escapes with it. In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old <br>
         Johnny Blaze, offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Johnny's soul. The next morning, Johnny awakens <br>
         to discover the cancer cured, but his father dies later that same day from burns sustained in a stunt accident.<br>
         Johnny accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers his side of the contract <br>
         fulfilled and promises to see Johnny again.  
       
       Mephistopheles' son Blackheart comes to Earth and seeks aid from the Hidden<br>
        (three fallen angels bonded with the elements of air, earth, and water) to find the lost contract of San Venganza.
