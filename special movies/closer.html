			is a British documentary film by first time director Richard de Aragues. The film is narrated by Jared Leto and charts the Isle of Man TT motorcycle race<br>
			 that takes place on the Isle of Man every year. It follows the leading riders in the 2010 race, most notably Guy Martin and Ian Hutchinson. <br>
	 
	 
			It was shot in 3D, and charts the racers' dedication and the risks involved in their bid to become King of the Mountain. The film was released <br>
			to the public in 2011 to critical acclaim and was a financial success. Grossing $2 million, it is the seventh highest-grossing documentary<br>
			 in the United Kingdom.
		   
			The film reveals how, for more than 100 years, riders have come to the Isle of Man to compete. The narration suggests that the TT has always<br>
			 called for a commitment far beyond any other racing event, and since the race began over 200 people have died in the races. <br>
	 
		   
			The second half of the film introduces Bridget Dobbs, mother of two and widow of Paul Dobbs ("Dobsy") who died in the 2010 races.<br>
			 Bridget understands and accepts that her husband, like many others, died doing something he loved. Despite the near fatal injuries,<br>
			  the film shows how those that survive all want to go back and do it again.
